The Multi-Person Pose Estimation is a model designed for sports and exercise-based applications. The model can detect six people in an image or video simultaneously, and 17 key-point joints per person.
The Multi-Person Pose Estimation is a model designed for sports and exercise-based applications. It is intended to be used between three to six feet from your camera or webcam. 

One of the main use case of this project is kinematics which is the analysis of body at different angles and joints within a body using movenet lightning and tensorflow.

Libraries used for this project are :
OpenCV library.
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. 
TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub. TensorFlow Hub is a repository consisting of trained machine learning models which you can download and use in any of your projects.
 
Some of the Applications for this model are:
To determine the correctness of poses of yoga class members during a yoga class.
To establish which swimmers have the best swimming strokes and those who need improvements during swimming lessons.
During supervision of a tennis lesson. The model would help analyze the people with correct and incorrect stroke positions.
In medical contexts to identify abnormal poses in patients
